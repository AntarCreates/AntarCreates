Greetings! I am Antar, a current undergraduate student in the Department of Mechatronics Engineering at Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology (RUET).
I finished my higher secondary education at Notre Dame College in Dhaka. I also double as a freelance writer with expertise in academic and review articles.

I've had a lifelong fascination with bleeding-edge technology, the arts, and literature. Therefore, one could argue that my interests are diverse. 
I'm a natural improviser rather than a slow-paced planner, and it's never let me down. I hope we get along well.
